# BILRED-CIPHER
This C++ program implements a simple Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting text by shifting letters. It handles uppercase and lowercase, leaving other characters unchanged. Users choose an operation (encrypt/decrypt), enter text, and provide a shift key. The program then outputs the processed text.

Actually, this was an assignment for our Computer Programming Subject. But it looked kinda boring(or maybe not that worth it), so I thought, why not make it stand out by sharing it at my Github Page
