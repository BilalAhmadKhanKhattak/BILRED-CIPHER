# BILRED-CIPHER
This C++ program implements a simple Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting text by shifting letters. It handles uppercase and lowercase, leaving other characters unchanged. Users choose an operation (encrypt/decrypt), enter text, and provide a shift key. The program then outputs the processed text.
